Thought:
Aim to replace the traditional “general agent” roles such as planning, research, analysis, and execution.

LLM Agent
Train or fine-tune a small LLM model with a structured dataset or an AI-generated dataset. The dataset can be tailored to a specific vertical domain.

Tool
Design a drag-and-drop frontend application that allows users to easily create their own agents and upload or generate the corresponding datasets.

Deploy
Once the design is complete, the backend will automatically generate a customized LLM model.

Workflow
User question/command -> LLM agent model <-> LLM model -> Answer
